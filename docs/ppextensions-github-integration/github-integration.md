# Github Integration

# About
A Jupyter extension to integrate notebooks with Github. This extension simplifies version controlling, sharing and resolving merge conflicts of notebooks.

### (Method 1) Local Environment Setup

#### Install Github Extension

~~~
cd PPExtensions/ppextensions/extensions/github
jupyter nbextension install static
jupyter nbextension enable static/github --user --section=tree
jupyter nbextension enable static/githubmain --user --section=tree
jupyter nbextension enable static/githubcommit --user --section=notebook
jupyter serverextension enable --user ppextensions.extensions.github.github
~~~

Alternatively, if you want to install all extensions in ppextension module
~~~
cd PPExtensions
bash build/extension_init.sh
~~~

This command will automatically install all frontend and backend Jupyter extensions we provide.

#### Local Setup

**Register private Github token:** Go to Github website, click `Settings` --> `Developer settings` --> `Personal access tokens` --> `Generate new token`, copy the new token and export that as an environment variable.
~~~
export githubtoken=<Your token here>
~~~

Notice if the token is replaced, all local repo will be "unlinked" to remote. 
**Enable git merge driver:**
To show conflict in notebook, a nbmerge driver from nbdime module should be enabled as well.
~~~
git-nbmergedriver config --enable --global
~~~

**(Optional) Initialize a Github repo for notebooks**

If you want to create a separate repo for sharing the notebooks, go to github website and create a new repo, be sure to create a README as well in order to initialize the master branch, otherwise when you pull the repo, there will be a "master branch not found" error. 

**(Optional) Use an existing Github repo for sharing the notebooks**
Either push to or pull from that repo will create a local workspace in Private Sharing folder in the notebook startup folder.

### (Method 2) Use Docker
~~~
docker run --name=demo --link=mysql:db -i -t -e githubtoken=<your github token here> -e githubname=<github user> -e githubemail=<github email> -p 8080:8080 -p 8888:8888 qwjlegend/ppextensions

~~~

Then go to localhost:8888/?token=<jupyter notebook token printed in the command line> to start using notebook with ppextensions.

#### Push to Github

**Push a single notebook to Github:** Select the notebook to be pushed, click `Sharing` --> `Push to Github`, select the repo, branch and type commit messages in the popup, and click on `Push`.

When you push a notebook outside the `Sharing` folder, the notebook will be moved under `Sharing/<Repo Name>/<Notebook Name>` path, and the be pushed to Github.
When you push a notebook inside the `Sharing` folder, only the "Linked" repo in the dropdown will display in the dropdown.

In the following situation, the push command will fail: 

***During a merge:*** Cannot do partial commit during a merge, please choose commit all notebooks option and push. Notice: this operation will push all other notebooks in this repo!

***There is a conflict:*** Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally. Please do git pull and fix the possible conflicts before pushing again!

**Push a folder to Github:** Select the folder, click on `Sharing` --> `Push to Github`, select the repo, branch and type commit messages in the popup, and click on `Push`. 

When you push a folder outside the `Sharing` folder, that entire folder will be moved under "Sharing/<Repo Name>" path, and then be pushed to Github.


#### Pull from Github

Click on `Sharing` --> `Pull from Github`, copy the Github repo url and paste that in the input area, then click on `Pull`. 

In the following situations, the pull command will fail:

***During a merge:*** You have not conclued your merge(MERGE_HEAD exists). Please, commit your changes before you can merge.

***There is a conflict:*** Auto-mergeing **.ipynb. CONFLICT(content): Merge conflict in **.ipynb. Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

***Untracked notebook in local:*** Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge: xx.ipynb. Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge. Aborting.

#### Commit

Open up a notebook, click on the Github icon in the tool bar. There are two types of commit:

**Commit one notebook:** This option will be used in most cases. 

In the following situations, this command will fail:

***Worktree clean, nothing to commit***

***There are other untracked/uncommitted notebooks:*** Nothing committed but untracked files presented. 

***During a merge:***Cannot do partial commit during a merge, please choose commit all notebooks option and push. Notice: this operation will push all other notebooks in this repo!

**Commit all notebooks in the same folder:** This option will only be used when a merge conflict is fixed. 


#### Conflict Fix

When you pull from Github and you local commit is different from remote commit, a conflict will be generated, if the conflict cannot be automatically resolved, you should fix the conflicts.

In the error message, the conflicting files will be displayed. 

Notice: The merge-driver is depending on nbdime module,  while it is working well in identifying "cell level" conflicts, it doe not fully support "notebook level" merging. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that a "notebook level" conflict (such as a deleted cell/added cell) will be identified in 100 percent correctness. Before the improved ndime module is released, we would recommend the user to keep the number of cells unchanged in a collaborative circumstance. 

To commit, first click on the Github icon in the notebook toolbar, choose either `Commit this notebook only` or `Commit all notebooks in this folder`, then click on `Commit`.
