## Contribution Process

* Create an issue branch using the master branch.
* Make modifications to the code.
* Ensure code coverage by added test cases.
* All commits must have the issue ID & summary. Say "[#32] Add Codacy Integration and Badge".
* Ensure all your commits are squashed.
* Make a Pull Request to develop branch.
* If there are code review related changes - ensure those commits are also squashed.
* DO NOT include changes that are not directly related to the issue you are trying to resolve.
* Once PR is approved, code will be merged to Development branch.
* Once all regression test cases have passed - changes will be merged to master branch.
